To begin the program, you must run the main.py file. Afterwards, you must the respective values for the Number of Nodes and the Max number of connections, you can generate a graph. 
There are two conditions which must be met. The max number of connections must always be one below the number of nodes and the number of nodes must not exceed a 1000. If the second condition
is not met, the program will still print the output of Kruskal's and Prim's algorithm, but it will not be shown on the GUI.
After all this, you will be able to create a Minimum Spanning Tree using the two algorithms: Prim's and Kruskal's.
